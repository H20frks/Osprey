## Final Assembly

A variety of switches may be used. For simplicity, a single switch for both the microcontroller and igniter is used here. Below is a photo of everything installed to a 2.6" e-bay sled.

In short, the final assembly includes:
* Connect the igniter to the micrcontroller via the terminal blocks.
* Connect the battery to the switch and the switch to the igniter and microcontroller.
  * JST wires and [a JST breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1862) are used in the photo above to make for quick connects/disconnects.
* Your local hardware store will have machine screws and nuts that fit in the mount holes on the microcontroller and IMU for mounting to the e-bay sled.
* Two holes were drilled through igniter's PCB for mounting in the photo above.
